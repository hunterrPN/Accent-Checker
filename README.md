Predict the speaker’s accent from audio using MFCCs, audio augmentation, and classical ML models.

This project predicts the accent of a speaker from a .wav audio sample using machine learning. It is built as a complete end-to-end pipeline including:

🎧 Audio preprocessing and augmentation

🔍 Feature extraction (MFCC, ZCR, RMSE)

🧠 Model training and evaluation (Random Forest / Logistic Regression)

🧪 Data versioning via DVC

🌐 Streamlit app for real-time accent prediction
